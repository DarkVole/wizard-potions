# wizard-potions

Wizard Potions is a simple Vue.js program that demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), which are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications, much like the React language I learned in Bloc, but is easier to learn and execute.

This project leverage many Google tools and features: There are several aspects worth noting:

1. The use Materialize, a UI component library which is created with CSS, JavaScript and HTML. Thus, it has the look and feel of many Google tools, like their surveys and forms. 

2. It uses some Google Fonts, especially handwriting fonts by Kimberly Geswein that were used for ingredients to make the list more manually created.

3. The database is Firebase, which is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provided by Google. 

4. The hosting is also done on Firebase.



This project was done with lessons from a udemy course in less than a week to demonstrate the ability to learn and execute a new language in a short amount of time.
